### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer - specializing in web & mobile software, with some experience in data science, hardware, blockchains and physics/mathematics. After my engineering education & MBA, I have worked with tech startups in roles as diverse as co-founder, product management and engineering leadership for more than 15 years. 

I maintain a list of [my current projects](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/now). I love open-source and contribute changes wherever I can. For the last 3 years, I have been working on this personal open-source Wikiversity-like project called [LearnAwesome.org](https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn). You can see some of my past work [here](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/work).

I also like to [make music](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/music) and [learn new things](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/learning). If you wish to contact me about something, please [send me a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi).
