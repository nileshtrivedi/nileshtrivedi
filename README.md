### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer - specializing in web & mobile software, with some experience in data science, hardware, blockchains and physics/mathematics. After my engineering education & MBA, I have worked with tech startups and companies like Meta/WhatsApp and ClearTax in roles as diverse as hands-on engineer, co-founder, and engineering leadership for almost 20 years. Fundamentally, I love both hacking and engineering.

I maintain a list of [my current projects](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/now). I love open-source and contribute changes wherever I can. For the last 3 years, I have been working on this personal open-source Wikiversity-like project called [LearnAwesome.org](https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn). You can see some of my past work [here](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/work).

I also like to learn maths and [make music](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/music). If you wish to contact me about something, please [send me a message on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@nilesh).
