### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer - specializing in web & mobile software, with experience in data science, hardware, blockchains and physics &amp; mathematics. After my engineering & MBA, I have worked with tech startups in roles as diverse as co-founder, engineering, and product management for almost 14 years. Here is my (outdated) [resume](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/Nilesh_Trivedi_CV.pdf).

I am based in Bengaluru (India) and work for [ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/){:target='_blank'}. I maintain a list of [my current projects](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/now). You can see some of my past work [here](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/work) or at [GitHub](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi){:target='_blank'} and [contact me](https://twitter.com/nileshtrivedi){:target='_blank'}.

I also like to [make music](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/music) and [learn new things](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/learning).
