### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a [deepstack engineer](https://x.com/nileshtrivedi/status/1714573851567513788) - specializing in web/mobile apps with machine learning and AI with additional experience in hardware, blockchains and scientific computing. After my engineering education & MBA, I have worked with tech startups and companies like Meta and ClearTax in roles as diverse as hands-on engineer, co-founder, and engineering leadership for almost 20 years.

[This](https://nilesh.trivedi.link/now) is what I am upto these days. I also maintain a list of my [requests for hacks](https://codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks). I love open-source and contribute improvements wherever I can. Here are some of my open-source projects:

- [isFixable.com](https://isfixable.com): A crowdsourced wiki to document the repair-friendliness of various consumer hardware products in India

- [aicombinator](https://github.com/aicombinator/bot): An GPT-based personal assistant bot that runs locally, understands tasks in natural language and with a human-reviewed library of composable tasks, can perform complex online tasks across multiple websites and webapps, by driving a browser on your local machine or call APIs when available.

- [LearnDB](https://github.com/learn-awesome/learndb/): A universal, open-source map of learning resources that helps you discover the right material at the right time with reviews from your trusted friends and experts.

- [Better](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/better): A browser extension that suggests healthy/ethical/better alternatives to products/businesses you are currently browsing

I also like to learn maths and [make music](https://nilesh.trivedi.link/music). If you wish to contact me about something, please send me a message on [Twitter](https://x.com/nileshtrivedi), [ActivityPub](https://fosstodon.org/@nilesh) or [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/nilesh.trivedi.link).
