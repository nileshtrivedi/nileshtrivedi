### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineer - specializing in web & mobile software, with some experience in data science, hardware, blockchains and physics/mathematics. After my engineering education & MBA, I have worked with tech startups and companies like Meta/WhatsApp and ClearTax in roles as diverse as hands-on engineer, co-founder, and engineering leadership for almost 20 years. Fundamentally, I love both hacking and engineering.

I maintain a list of [my current projects](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/now) and my [requests for hacks](https://codeberg.org/nilesh/request-for-hacks). I love open-source and contribute changes wherever I can. Here are some of my open-source projects:

- [aicombinator](https://github.com/aicombinator/bot): An GPT-based personal assistant bot that runs locally, understands tasks in natural language and with a human-reviewed library of composable tasks, can perform complex online tasks across multiple websites and webapps, by driving a browser on your local machine or call APIs when available.

- [LearnAwesome.org](https://learnawesome.org/): A universal, open-source map of learning resources that helps you discover the right material at the right time with reviews from your trusted friends and experts.

- [Better](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/better): A browser extension that suggests healthy/ethical/better alternatives to products/businesses you are currently browsing

- [Polyglot.Network](https://github.com/PolyglotNetwork): An experimental business model for funding open-source projects. I  believe that expecting individuals to contribute to FOSS is unreasonable when most of the benefits are being extracted by corporations.

I also like to learn maths and [make music](https://nilesh.trivedi.pw/music). If you wish to contact me about something, please [send me a message on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@nilesh).
